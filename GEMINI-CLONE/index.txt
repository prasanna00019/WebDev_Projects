## How to make Dosa: A Step-by-Step Guide **Ingredients:** * 1 cup rice (preferably parboiled) * 1/2 cup urad dal (black gram) * 1/4 cup methi seeds (fenugreek seeds) * Salt to taste * Oil for cooking **Instructions:** **1. Soaking and Grinding:** * Wash the rice and urad dal separately and soak them in separate bowls of water for at least 4 hours. * Grind the soaked urad dal and methi seeds together into a smooth paste. You can use a blender or a grinder for this. * Drain the rice and grind it separately until it is coarsely ground. * Combine the ground urad dal paste and rice paste in a large bowl. **2. Fermentation:** * Add salt to the batter and mix well. * Cover the batter with a clean cloth and let it ferment at room temperature for 8-12 hours. The batter should rise and develop a slightly sour smell. **3. Making the Dosa:** * Heat a non-stick pan or tawa over medium heat. * Pour a ladleful of batter onto the hot pan, spreading it outwards to form a thin, circular dosa. * Drizzle a little oil around the edges of the dosa. * Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy. **4. Serving:** * Serve hot with your favorite chutneys and sambhar. **Tips:** * You can use a dosa pan or a griddle for making dosas. * If the batter is too thick, you can add a little water to thin it out. * If the batter is too thin, you can add a little more rice flour. * You can add a pinch of sugar to the batter for a slightly sweet dosa. * Experiment with different fillings for your dosas, such as potatoes, onions, and paneer. * For a thicker dosa, pour a little more batter onto the pan. **Enjoy your delicious and crispy dosa!** **Variations:** * **Masala Dosa:** Filled with a spiced potato mixture. * **Rava Dosa:** Made with semolina (rava) instead of rice. * **Set Dosa:** A thick and crispy dosa. * **Paper Dosa:** A thin and delicate dosa. * **Uttapam:** A thick and savory dosa topped with vegetables.
